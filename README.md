An e-commerce website is an online platform where businesses sell products or services directly to customers. Think of it as a digital storefront that's open 24/7.

Essential Components
Product Catalog - This is where you display your products with images, descriptions, prices, and specifications. Good product pages are crucial for conversions.
Shopping Cart - Customers add items here before purchasing. It should be easy to modify quantities, remove items, and see the total cost.
Payment Gateway - This securely processes credit cards, digital wallets (like PayPal, Apple Pay), and other payment methods. Popular options include Stripe, PayPal, and Square.
User Accounts - Customers can create profiles to track orders, save addresses, and store payment information for faster checkout.
Search and Filters - Help customers find products quickly through search bars and filtering by category, price, size, color, etc.
Checkout Process - Should be streamlined and secure, collecting shipping information and payment details efficiently.
